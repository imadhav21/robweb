                <h2>                 
                    Understanding What is Going On                        
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two main methods of the distance transform used, namely the distanceTransformSlow() and distanceTransformManhattan(). 
                    
                    <br><br> For the slow(), we first looped through each cell in the 
                    graph. And for each cell in the graph, we looped through all the cells again in order to find the minimum distance of the orginal cell to an occupied cell. The benefit of this is that it found the direct distance to an occupied cell from a cell. 
                    However, this is a very tedious approach as this 
                    operates in N^2 time, meaning as the graph gets larger and larger, it will take longer and longer to complete. 
                    
                    <br><br>However, the Manhattan() solved this issue. While it did not find the direct distance, it instead found the block distance (going up, down, left, right, and not diagonally) for each cell to every occupied cell. While this calculated slightly longer distances to the nearest
                    object for each cell, the implementation of this method worked very well, and was much more faster than the slow(). When testing the code on the robot, the Manhattan() ran incredebly faster compared to the slow().
                    For the Manhattan(), we did an implementation of a forwards pass and then a backwards pass. First, the graph was initialized, 
                    meaning if a cell was occupied, it would set the obstacle distance to 0, and if it was not occupied, it would set it to a very high value. The forward pass would then get the minimum value of itself, its top neighbor + 1, or its left neighbor + 1.
                    The reason for the +1 is so that it basically increments by 1 from an occupied cell. The same concept is for the backwards pass, whicn starts at the end of the graph and gets the min of itself, the right neightbor + 1, or the left neighbor + 1.

                    <br><br> Aside from this, two other vectors were involved, namely the createAttractive() and createRepulsive(). These functions do what the name suggestly, namely Attractive() loops through each cell and find the euclidian, or shortest, distance to the goal cell.
                    This makes the robot want to follow the low values and avoid the high values. However, the Repulsive() comes into picture to help avoid obstacles. An exponential function was being used that basically helps to squash negative values, and helps normalize
                    it in a sense. The equation used was exp(-C * obstacle_dists[i]), and this basically keeps the values between 0 and 1, with C making the graph have either a very steep slope or a gradual slope.

                    <br><br>Once this is done, the createPotential() is next, where for each cell in the graph, the createAttractive() and createRepulsive() were combined together. 

                    <br><br> A side note: We were able to start progress on the Euclidian2D(), which is basically a much better version that both of above mentioned distance transforms. It involves a lot of math. specifically dealing with parabolas. But unfortunately we did not get it to work as intended. 
                    While it does a bit in the web app, we never got to test it on the robot.

                            The strengths and Weaknesses of this Implementation                        
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the strengths of the potential field application is that it is able to avoid obstacles well in theory, albeit at a low level. The repulsive field helps to repel the robot away from the walls so it can get to the goal.
                            <br><br>
                            However, there are quite a bit of problems with this application. Namely, it cannot do anything complex, like a maze. Even if the goal is right behind an obstacle like a wall, the robot will drive to the wall and it will think it has reached the goal.
                            That was a big problem while testing it out, that it would basically get stuck behind a wall of some sort and think it reached the goal.
                            <br><br>
                            One challenge we faced when testing the robot was that the potential field worked well in the simulation for reasonable goals, but in the real world, while it looked to repel slightly, it did not repel enough at times, and slightly hit some walls. We tried to tune
                            the robot so it would repel further, but our efforts seemed to be futile. Many different numbers were changed, but the robot never seemed to repel itself enough from certain objects.
                            <br><br>
                            One way I could think to improve this algorithm is instead of having this solely rely on the potential field and the robot going toward the low values, there could be a check that asks if the robot has reached its goal destination
                            If it has not reached its goal, then it realizes it is in a local minimum, and a new path must be sought out. Or another way could be having the robot calculate multiple paths to the goal, and seeing which one actually makes sense and avoid going into the 
                            high value area, meaning closer to obsticles, as best as possible.
